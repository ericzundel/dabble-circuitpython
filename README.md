# dabble-circuitpython

The Dabble app from Stempedia has a nice UI for controlling embedded
code over bluetooth.  Their examples are written in C++ for arduino, 
but they've made the code open source.  This library will help 
CircuitPython users to be able to use the Dabble app

Initial support is for the Game Controller mode.
